# Yrkesprov â€“ Food Ordering Application

This is my first C# Windows Forms application developed as part of my final exam project (*yrkesprov*). The application simulates a fast-food ordering system where users can select items like burgers, fries, and drinks, and receive a detailed receipt with calculated totals.

## Features

  Order Management
View and manage current meal orders from the database in a user-friendly interface.

  Add & Confirm Orders
Add new orders and confirm them â€” confirmed orders are moved to the sold table.

  Delete Orders
Easily remove selected meals from the order list.

  Total Calculation
Automatically calculates the total price of all selected meals.

  Receipt Printing
Generate and preview printable receipts using system print dialogs.

  Clear Order Table
Automatically clears the valet table after printing or confirming an order.

  Data Persistence
All order data is stored and retrieved from a SQL Server database using ADO.NET.


## Technologies Used

- C# (.NET Framework)
