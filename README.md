# Yrkesprov – Food Ordering Application

This is my first C# Windows Forms application developed as part of my final exam project (*yrkesprov*). The application simulates a fast-food ordering system where users can select items like burgers, fries, and drinks, and receive a detailed receipt with calculated totals.

## Features

- **Order Management**: View and manage current meal orders from the database.
- **Add & Confirm Orders**: Add new orders and confirm them — confirmed orders are moved to the sold table.
- **Delete Orders**: Easily remove selected meals from the order list.
- **Total Calculation**: Automatically calculates the total price of all selected meals.
- **Receipt Printing**: Generate and preview printable receipts.
- **Clear Order Table**: Automatically clears the order table after printing or confirming.
- **Data Persistence**: All order data is stored in a SQL Server database using ADO.NET.


## Technologies Used

- C# (.NET Framework)
- Windows Forms
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Git & GitHub
